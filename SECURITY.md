# 🔒 Security Policy

The Cloud Solutions team takes the security of our software and services seriously.
To ensure a safe and secure experience for all users, we have outlined clear guidelines for identifying, reporting, and addressing security vulnerabilities.

## 🚩 Reporting a Vulnerability

### What NOT to do

- Please **do not** report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.
- Please **do not** publicly disclose the issue until we have addressed it.
- Please **do not** send the report to any other email, different from the above.

## ✨ Best Practices

To help maintain security when using our software or services:

- Keep your dependencies and services up to date.

We value all contributions equally and therefore don’t compensate specific ones, including those by security researchers.
This approach ensures fairness across our open-source community.
