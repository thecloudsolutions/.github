# 🚀 Supported Versions
> [!WARNING]
> Cloud Solutions primarily supports the latest major version of each project to ensure the highest levels of performance and security.
> While we strongly encourage users to stay up-to-date, critical security patches may, at our discretion, be applied to older versions if deemed necessary.

# 🐛 Bug Bounties
> [!CAUTION]
> Cloud Solutions **does not** provide bug bounties for vulnerability disclosures.
> As an open-source company, we release our projects for free under a permissive license, encouraging community contributions.
> We value all contributions equally and therefore don’t compensate specific ones, including those by security researchers.
> This approach ensures fairness across our open-source community.
> Thank you for your understanding.

# 🛡️ Security Best Practices
> [!TIP]
> To help maintain security when using our software or services:
> - Keep your dependencies and services up to date.
> - Follow the principle of least privilege when managing AWS resources.
> - Use secure credentials and rotate them regularly.
> - Subscribe to security advisories or release updates to stay informed about critical patches.

# 🌍 Preferred Languages
> [!NOTE]
> We prefer all communications to be in English.
