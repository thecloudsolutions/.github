# üîç FAQ

> [!TIP]
>
> ## üí≠ Answers to your questions
>
> <details>
> <summary>What if we don't want to use AWS?</summary>
> We understand that AWS might not be everyone's choice. We can certainly appreciate the strengths of platforms like Azure and GCP, but AWS is our specialty, and we stick to what we know best. If AWS isn't what you're looking for, we're probably not the right fit. You'll get the best results with a team that's as passionate about other platforms as we are about AWS. We believe in doing one thing really well, and for us, that's AWS.
> </details>
> <details>
> <summary>What if we have already invested in Infrastructure as Code?</summary>
> We value the work you've put into your infrastructure. Where it makes sense, we'll aim to integrate and improve upon your existing Infrastructure as Code, especially any code that is specific to your applications. We aim to enhance and optimize your infrastructure, integrating it with AWS best practices for a seamless and efficient operation.
> </details>
> <details>
> <summary>Can we still maintain control over our AWS infrastructure after setup?</summary>
> Absolutely. We believe in transparency and control. Our main goal is to set up and optimise your AWS environment, but you retain full ownership and control. We'll provide the knowledge and tools for your team to take the wheel and successfully navigate your AWS infrastructure.
> </details>
> <details>
> <summary>We're a small startup, will this work for us?</summary>
> Your size doesn't dictate your ability to leverage AWS. Whether you're big or small, what matters is your willingness to adapt and scale. It's about where you're going, not where you are right now. If your startup's goals align with the efficiency, scalability, and innovation that AWS provides, we're likely a good match. Let's have a conversation to determine if our services can accelerate your journey.
> </details>
> <details>
> <summary>What if we need a custom AWS solution that isn't listed in your services?</summary>
> We love challenges! Our team thrives on crafting custom solutions that meet your specific needs. Whether you have a requirement that's off the beaten path or need innovation that's not on our standard list, we're eager to dive in. We're ready to listen, understand, and develop the AWS infrastructure that's just right for you. Let's collaborate to create a solution that's as unique as your business.
> </details>
> <details>
> <summary>Are your solutions suitable for any industry?</summary>
> Yes, they generally are. AWS offers a broad set of tools that can be customized for different industries, and we've got the experience to match those tools to your specific needs. Each industry comes with its own set of challenges and requirements, and our team is skilled at tailoring AWS solutions that respect these nuances. From healthcare compliance to fintech security, we customize our services to fit your industry's demands
