# 🛠️ Support

Thank you for using and contributing to Cloud Solutions! We’re here to help ensure you have a smooth experience with our projects. This document outlines how to get support and where to find answers to common questions.

## ‼️ Before Seeking Support

Before reaching out for help, please:

- **Check the Documentation**: Review the project’s `README.md` and other documentation files for guidance.
- **Search Issues**: Look through the [GitHub Issues](../../issues) to see if your question or problem has already been addressed.
- **Try the Latest Version**: Ensure you’re using the latest version of the software, as the issue may already be resolved.

## ⁉️ How To Get Help

When requesting support, always include:

- A clear description of the issue.
- Steps to reproduce the problem.
- Relevant logs or screenshots.

### **GitHub Issues**

- Use [GitHub Issues](../../issues) to report bugs or problems with the project.
- Ensure you provide as much detail as possible by following the [Bug Report Template](https://github.com/thecloudsolutions/.github/blob/main/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/02-bug-report.yml).
- Avoid using issues for general questions or support requests.

> [!CAUTION]
> **Do Not Duplicate**  
> Before creating a new issue, check if a similar one already exists to avoid duplicates.

### **Feature Requests**

- Have an idea for a new feature or improvement? Submit your suggestion using the [Feature Request Template](https://github.com/thecloudsolutions/.github/blob/main/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/01-feature-request.yml).
- Include clear use cases and explain how the feature would benefit users.

### **Private Matters**

If your issue cannot be discussed publicly (e.g., security-related matters or sensitive topics):

- Open a new GitHub Issue and add a clear title, such as `[Private Matter]`.
- Label the issue as `confidential`, if such a label is set up for your repository.
- Mention in the issue that you need to share details privately, and a maintainer will guide you further.

> [!WARNING]
> Sensitive issues should be reported responsibly and discreetly. Use clear titles without sharing confidential information in public threads.
